## Advent of Code 2024 - Rust Solutions

Welcome to my solutions for the [Advent of Code 2024](https://adventofcode.com/2024) challenges using the Rust programming language. This repository contains my personal approach to solving the puzzles, focusing on clean code, readability, and learning Rust along the way.

## Running the Solutions

To run the solutions, you'll need to have Rust installed on your system. You can download it from the [official Rust website](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install).

Once you have Rust installed, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/advent-of-code-2024-rust.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory then the specific day: `cd advent-of-code-2024-rust/day-XX`
3. Run a specific solution, for example, part 1: `cargo run --bin part1`

The solutions will read input data from the `input.txt` file, located in the `src` of the project. You can replace the provided input files with your own data if needed.

## Contributing

If you have any suggestions or improvements for the solutions, feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request. I'm always looking to learn and grow as a Rust developer.
